# Networking basics #0

This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts while learning about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.
# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

    0. OSI model
        0-OSI_model: Text file answering the following questions:
        What is the OSI model?
            Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
            The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.
            The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology.
        How is the OSI model organized?
            Alphabetically
            From the lowest to the highest level
            Randomly

    1. Types of network
        1-types_of_network: Text file answering the following questions:
        What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
            Internet
            WAN
            LAN
        What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
            Internet
            WAN
            LAN
        What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?
            Internet
            WAN
            LAN

    2. MAC and IP address
        2-MAC_and_IP_address: Text file answering the following questions:
        What is a MAC address?
            The name of a network interface
            The unique identifier of a network interface
            A network interface
        What is an IP address?
            Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
            The unique identifier of a network interface
            Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

    3. UDP and TCP
        3-UDP_and_TCP: Text file answering the following questions:
        Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
            It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
            It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
        Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
            It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
            It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
        Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
            Have you received boxes x, y, z?
            May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?

    4. TCP and UDP ports
        4-TCP_and_UDP_ports: Bash script that displays listening ports.
        That only shows listening sockets.
        That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

    5. Is the host on the network
        5-is_the_host_on_the_network: Bash script that pings an IP address received as an argument 5 times.
        Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}.
